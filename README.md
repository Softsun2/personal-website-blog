# Personal Website/Blog

## Technologies
* Typescript (maybe)
* React
* Tailwind CSS

## Idea
Build a *pretty* portfolio, with art projects, ramblings, etc. More personal content will have limited access. I like the idea of archiving, it would be neat if I was able to generate like a wayback machine for the site to document the site's look. I want making posts to be simple and seperate from the website but easily added to the website. This is also learning experience, should cover all basic web app components, cookies, persistent data, api, tests, scalable, etc...
